HTML to DNA Sequence

#Each oligo is 115bp long
#Each oligo consists of 19bp address to identify segments
#Each oligo has 96bp of data i.e. 12 bytes of data (1byte of data takes up 8 bp therefore 8*12=96 and 12 bytes)
#Each oligo is flanked by 22bp universal primers for amplification (22 forward and 22 reverse)
#Each address is encoded using a 19 bit binary number allowing upto 2^19 = 524288 uniques oligo addresses

Step 1: Initialize the variables
-Prepare file variables for input and output
-Set up base pair mapping and synonyms (0-> A or C and 1-> G or T)

Step 2: Define parameters
- Number of bytes for each oligo => N=12
- Length of the address bit => 19bp
- F and R primers (22 bp long)

Step 3: Initialize counters
- Counter for bytes processed n=0
- Seed =2 for uniform reproducibility
- u1, u2, u3 to track last three bases to avoid homopolymers

Step 4: Open input and output file

Step 5: Read input file as chunks (64 kb) and convert it to bytes

Step 6: convert bytes to DNA sequence
- For each byte call the subroutine byte_to_basepair

Step 7: Append the returned DNA sequence to the output file and increment byte counter

Step 8: Insert primers for every 12 bytes. Also insert padding if the oligo length is not 12 bytes

Step 9: Calculate next segment address using the subroutine address_to_basepair
- each address is a 19 bit long binary number  ranging from 0000000000000000001 to 1111111111111111111

Step 10: Write the data to the output file and close files
Each oligo now consists of forward primer 22bp + address 19bp + data 96 bp + reverse primer 22bp

Subroutines:
byte_to_basepair(byte):
- Extract 8 bits (MSB goes first)
- For each bit, randomly map nucleotide
- Check for homopolymers, if they occur, then replace with synonyms
- append to base DNA sequence and return the 8bp long DNA sequence

address_to_basepair(number):
- for each bit in the address call byte_to_base pair and convert to DNA sequnces
- return the final DNA sequence address
